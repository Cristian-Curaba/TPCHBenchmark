\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to study an efficient implementation of a Postgres database using the public TPC-H benchmark, which can be considered as a Big Data source.

\subsection{TPC-H benchmark database}

The TPC-H benchmark can be downloaded

\subsubsection{Database statistics}

The benchmark is composed by the following tables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CUSTOMER, with \num{1500000} tuples (\SI{312}{\mega\byte});
	\item LINEITEM, with \num{59986052} tuples (\SI{11}{\giga\byte}); the main attributes that are going to be used are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{l\_extendedprice} (\num{1351462} distinct values, i.e.\ there is an average of \num{44} tuples with the same value, that range from \num{900.91} to \num{104949.50}),
			\item \texttt{l\_discount} (\num{11} distinct values, i.e.\ there is an average of \num{5453277} tuples with the same value, that range from \num{0.00} to \num{0.10}),
			\item \texttt{l\_returnflag} (which can assume values \texttt{A}$\rightarrow$not returned, \texttt{R}$\rightarrow$returned, \texttt{N}$\rightarrow$not yet delivered),
			\item l\_commitdate,
			\item l\_receiptdate,
		\end{itemize}
	\item NATION, with \num{25} tuples (\SI{24}{\kilo\byte});
	\item ORDERS, with \num{1500000} tuples (\SI{2481}{\kilo\byte}); the main attributes that are going to be used are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item o\_orderdate,
		\end{itemize}
	\item PART, with \num{2000000} tuples (\SI{363}{\mega\byte}); the main attributes that are going to be used are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item p\_type;
		\end{itemize}
	\item PARTSUPP, with \num{8000000} tuples (\SI{1535}{\mega\byte});
	\item REGION, with \num{5} tuples (\SI{24}{\kilo\byte});
	\item SUPPLIER, with \num{100000} tuples (\SI{20}{\mega\byte}).
\end{itemize}

Other attributes have been used (e.g., keys used to join relations), but statistics about them have been omitted for lack of usefulness.
