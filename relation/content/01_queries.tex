\subsection{Late delivery}

It is asked to retrieve the number of orders where at least one ``lineitem'' has been received later than the committed date.
The aggregation should be performed with the Month $\rightarrow$ Year roll-up, and the (Customer's) Nation $\rightarrow$ Region roll-up.

\begin{lstlisting}
    WITH lineitem_orders AS (
	SELECT
		o_orderkey, 
		l_partkey, 
		l_suppkey, 
		o_orderdate, 
		o_custkey,
		l_commitdate,
		l_receiptdate
	FROM lineitem JOIN orders ON (l_orderkey = o_orderkey)
), customer_location AS (
	SELECT 
		c_custkey, 
		n_nationkey AS c_nationkey, 
		n_name AS c_nationname, 
		r_regionkey AS c_regionkey, 
		r_name AS c_regionname 
	FROM customer 
		JOIN nation ON (c_nationkey = n_nationkey)
		JOIN region ON (n_regionkey = r_regionkey)
), query2 AS (
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS _year,
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate) AS _month,
	c_regionname,
	c_nationname,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(o_orderkey)) AS orders_no
FROM lineitem_orders
	JOIN part ON l_partkey = p_partkey
	JOIN customer_location ON (c_custkey = o_custkey)
WHERE 
	l_receiptdate > l_commitdate
	-- AND _month = 1
	-- AND p_type = 'PROMO BURNISHED COPPER'
GROUP BY
	_year,
	_month,
	c_regionkey,
	c_regionname,
	c_nationkey,
	c_nationname
)
SELECT * FROM query2;
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Returned item loss}

It is asked to retrieve the \textit{revenue loss} for customers who might be having problems with the parts that are shipped to them, where a \textit{revenue loss} is defined as
$$ \texttt{SUM(l\_extendedprice*(1-l\_discount))}$$
for all qualifying \textit{lineitems}.

\begin{lstlisting}
WITH lineitem_orders AS (
	SELECT 
		o_orderkey, 
		l_partkey, 
		l_suppkey, 
		o_orderdate, 
		o_custkey, 
		l_extendedprice, 
		l_discount, 
		l_returnflag,
		l_commitdate,
		l_receiptdate
	FROM lineitem JOIN orders ON (l_orderkey=o_orderkey)
),
query3 AS (
SELECT
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS _year,
	EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o_orderdate) AS _quarter,
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate) AS _month,
	c_name,
	SUM(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) AS returnloss
FROM
	lineitem_orders
	JOIN customer ON (o_custkey=c_custkey)
WHERE 
	l_returnflag='R'
	-- AND c_name='Customer#000129976'
	-- AND EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o_orderdate) = 1
GROUP BY
	_year,
	_quarter,
	_month,
	c_custkey,
	c_name
)
SELECT * FROM query3;
\end{lstlisting}

Five independent runs of the above query obtained the following execution times: \SI{753541.744}{\milli\s}, \SI{672530.120}{\milli\s}, \SI{624276.525}{\milli\s}, \SI{615741.447}{\milli\s} and \SI{634262.713}{\milli\s}.
