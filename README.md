# TPC-H benchmark

This repository contains the code for the final project of A.Y. 2022-2023
Professor Adriano Peron and Professor Dario Della Monica's course on **Data
Management for Big Data** at the University of Trieste.
The group is composed by Davide Capone ([@davidecapone](https://github.com/davidecapone)),
Sandro Junior Della Rovere ([@5JDR](https://github.com/5JDR)), and Enrico
Stefanel ([@enstit](https://github.com/enstit)).


## Problem statement

It is required to analyze the [TPC-H benchmark](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/),
which consists of a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent
data modifications. The aim of the project is to implement the database in
Postgres and study efficient data structures in order to optimize the assigned
queries on the database.
